# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

This repository contains a Python script that builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The script includes data preparation, model creation, training, evaluation, and testing on a custom image.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

- In this case, only 20,000 images were used for training and 4,000 images for testing.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Setup
